This is a grid version of the GADGET IC generator.

It use the psphray2 code for configuration files and IO.

To generate an IC, three steps shall be done:

0. write the paramfile (see datadir/paramfile for example)
1. On a super computer with huge memory, run
   ngenic.grid paramfile Nmesh
   for each desired mesh size(Nmesh) with MPI.
   this step calculates the FFT and dump the displacement field
   of selected regions at given sizes and positions.
   the computer needs to hold the entire FFT grid of the largest Nmesh

2. On the same super computer, with a free small node attached 
   to the same filesystem, run
   ngenic.grid -I paramfile Nmesh
   for each desired mesh size Nmesh, without MPI.
   (for the base level Nmesh this code will fail)
   this step creates the index of the points dumped in the first step

3. On a large shared memory machine, enough memory 
   to hold the entire zoom IC * ~2,
   run 
   python convert.py paramfile {gadget|ramses}
   to produce the final IC file for gadget or ramses
